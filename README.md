# Random Bitcoin Pizzas!
Everyone's Bitcoin transactions generate an unlimited number of random pizzas.

### What?
WebSocket amplifier. Pizza randomizer. Code storyteller.

### Why?
What would Bitcoin be without pizza? Well, it'd be just an experiment like this.

### How?
```
npm install;
npm run build;
npm run start;
```
Then, browse to http://localhost:3000/

#### Inspiration
Inspiration from [Maximillian Laumeister](https://github.com/MaxLaumeister) and his [bitlisten](https://www.bitlisten.com/) site as well as my desire to learn websockets.
